#  CODE SUMMARIZATION AND EVALUATION


## About The Project

Our software engineering project aims to create an easy-to-use system for code summarization and evaluation. It involves using GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate natural language summaries of source code to make it easier for various users to understand its purpose without deep technical knowledge. The system has three core components:

- User Authentication and Authorization: To secure access, with distinct roles for regular users who summarize and evaluate code, and administrators who manage the system.
- Code Summarization: Users input code into a text box and the system provides a set of natural language summaries, with an option to select the number of desired results, up to a maximum threshold.
- Results Evaluation: Users evaluate the summaries based on naturalness, usefulness, and consistency using a 5-point rating scale and can also give feedback in natural language. The system records these evaluations and can calculate and display average scores.


Our website aims to break down barriers and enable easy understanding of code, making it an invaluable tool for developers, students, and educators alike.


## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).


### Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. Install server-side dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Install MongoDB

    ```bash
    npm install mongodb
    ```
    
5. For routing, install the react router dom

    ```bash
    npm install react-router-dom
    ```

6. Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/).
7. Visit the MongoDB website, create a new database or cluster by following the instructions provided in the MongoDB documentation. Remember to note down the "Connect to your application URI" for the database, as you will need it.

8. Create two .env files - one in the root folder and the other in the my-backend folder

    ```bash
    REACT_APP_API_KEY = 'enter_your_api' -> in the root folder
    MONGO_URI = 'your-mongodb-uri' -> in the my-backend folder
    ```
   
    

## Running the Application

Now that you have installed all dependencies, you can run the application. Ensure that your MongoDB server is running.

1. Start the server:

    ```bash
    cd my-backend
    node server.js
    ```

2. Start the client:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The application should now be running locally. You can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.
## Usage
### LoginPage.js
- ⁠Implements a login page using React where users can log in by submitting their credentials.
- ⁠Prompts users to update their password through a change password dialog if the current password is "default."
-  ⁠Redirects authenticated users to their respective dashboards based on their roles.

### RegisterPage.js
- ⁠Implements a registration page using React that allows new users to create an account.
-   ⁠Validates the password, ensuring it meets specific criteria (length, character types) before enabling registration.
-  ⁠Redirects successfully registered users to the login page after form submission.

### Dashboard.js
-  Users can input code, specify the number of desired summaries, and submit to receive insights generated by OpenAI's model.
- The dashboard allows users to select, review, and provide detailed feedback on each summary, enhancing the interactive experience.
-  Features navigational links for user history and logout, with a responsive design powered by Material-UI for optimal usability.

### HistoryPage.js
- Enables users to view a historical log of their interactions, showcasing details such as input code and summary evaluations, with an emphasis on user-centric data security and privacy.
- Incorporates navigational functionality for easy access to the dashboard and a logout feature, ensuring a seamless user experience and secure session termination.
- Utilizes Material-UI components for a responsive layout, ensuring that history data is presented in an accessible and aesthetically pleasing manner.

### adminDashboard.js

- Implements an admin dashboard to provide user statistics, averages, and controls to navigate, manage roles, and logout.
-  Lists all users except the currently logged-in admin, providing checkboxes to select users for fetching their histories and displaying them.
-  Fetches and displays statistical data such as new users, total visits, and average scores (naturalness, consistency, usefulness) for selected or all users.
-  Shows each selected user's detailed history, including code summaries and feedback.

### ManageRoles.js

- This component allows administrators to manage user roles within a system, offering capabilities such as adding new users, updating roles, and deleting users as needed, enhancing administrative control and user management efficiency.
- Incorporates real-time search functionality to filter users based on the query, along with interactive dialogs for creating new users, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface for administrators.
- Features navigation options to administrative functions and secure logout capabilities, ensuring a smooth transition between different administrative tasks and secure management of user sessions.
